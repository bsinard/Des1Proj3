    <i><p>1. An idea is formed when you see something that compels you to create.</p>
    <p>2. I create in bursts. I string together many ideas. Art does not always need to meet a purpose. To give meaning to an object without one is fruitless.</p>
    <p>3. Assuming your work will be bad will make it bad. Self-hatred and humbleness are vastly different.</p>
    <p>4. To analyze art you are still creating is to give something to nothing.</p>
    <p>5. If it's stressing you out, you need to approach it differently. Art is a wild animal, it lashes out when nervous.</p>
    <p>6. You do not owe your viewers an explanation for everything you create.</p>
    <p>7. All perception of a creative work is inherently subjective. To open yourself to criticism is to give the floor to many differing voices. Diversity in opinion is very important.</p></i>
